1. ipfs : inter-planetary file System
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System
    * history : In 2014, the IPFS protocol took advantage of the Bitcoin blockchain protocol and network infrastructure in order to store unalterable data, remove duplicated files across the network, and obtain address information for accessing storage nodes to search for files in the network.[4][1]

    * Implementations in Go[5] and JavaScript[6] exist, and a Python implementation is in progress.[7] The Go implementation is considered to be the "reference implementation"[8] while formal specifications are developed.[9]

    * IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the World Wide Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high-throughput, content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks.[10] This forms a generalized Merkle directed acyclic graph (DAG). IPFS combines a distributed hash table, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.[11] Distributed Content Delivery saves bandwidth and prevents DDoS attacks which HTTP struggles with.

2. 802.11p : WAVE(wireless access in vehicular environments)
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11p
  * IEEE 802.11p is an approved amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard to add wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE), a vehicular communication system. It defines enhancements to 802.11 (the basis of products marketed as Wi-Fi) required to support Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. This includes data exchange between high-speed vehicles and between the vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, so called V2X communication, in the licensed ITS band of 5.9 GHz (5.85-5.925 GHz). IEEE 1609 is a higher layer standard based on the IEEE 802.11p.[1] It is also the base of a European standard for vehicular communication known as ETSI ITS-G5.

  * History: The 802.11p Task Group was formed in November 2004. Lee Armstrong was chair and Wayne Fisher technical editor. Drafts were developed from 2005 through 2009. By April 2010 draft 11 was approved by 99% affirmative votes and no comments.[7] The approved amendment was published July 15, 2010.[8] Its title was "Amendment 6: Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments". n August 2008 the European Commission allocated part of the 5.9 GHz band for priority transport safety applications[9] and inter-vehicle, infrastructure communications.[10] The intention is that compatibility with the USA will be ensured even if the allocation is not exactly the same; frequencies will be sufficiently close to enable the use of the same antenna and radio transmitter/receiver

  * V2x communication, which involves vehicles exchanging data with each other and the infrastructure, has proven to improve traffic safety and increase the efficiency of transportation systems. Direct Short Range Communication (DSRC), which is based on IEEE 802.11p, has been the subject of extensive standardization, product development and field trials by all stakeholders, proving its benefit for V2x. Unlike cellular technologies, DSRC is ready for V2x deployment today, and addresses the most challenging V2x use-cases.
